# Introduction to Google Cloud Platform

## 1. What is Google Cloud Platform?
Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube.

The Google Cloud Platform allows us not only to rent servers, but to use services in order to handle different scenarios as well, such as delivering content via cdn, dealing with big traffic, etc.
