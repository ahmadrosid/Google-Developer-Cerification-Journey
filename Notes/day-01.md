# Introduction to Google Cloud Platform

## 1. What is Google Cloud Platform?
Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube.

With Google Cloud Platform we are not only renting the server but we can also use the services available on Google Cloud Platform to handle different scenarios for your application like handle big traffic, deliver content via cdn etc.
